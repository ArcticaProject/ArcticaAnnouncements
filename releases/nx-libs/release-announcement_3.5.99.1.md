# Arctica Announcement (No. 00002): Release of nx-libs (version 3.5.99.1)

### Introduction

NX is a software suite which implements very efficient compression of the
X11 protocol. This increases performance when using X applications over a
network, especially a slow one.

NX (v3) has been originally developed by NoMachine and has been Free
Software ever since. Since NoMachine obsoleted NX (v3) some time back in
2013/2014, the maintenance has been continued by a versatile group of
developers. The work on NX (v3) is being continued under the project name
"nx-libs".

### Release Announcement

On Tuesday, Sep 13th, version 3.5.99.1 of nx-libs [has been released](https://github.com/ArcticaProject/nx-libs/releases/tag/3.5.99.1) [1].

This release brings some code cleanups regarding displayed copyright information and an improvement when it comes to reconnecting to already an running session from an X11 server with a color depths setup that is different from the X11 server setup where the NX/X11 session was originally created on. Furthermore, an issue reported to the X2Go developers has been fixed that caused problems on Windows clients on copy+paste actions between the NX/X11 session and the underlying MS Windows system. For details see [X2Go BTS, Bug #952](http://bugs.x2go.org/952) [3].
