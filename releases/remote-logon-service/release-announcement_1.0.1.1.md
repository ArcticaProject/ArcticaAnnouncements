# Arctica Announcement (No. 00007): Release of remote-logon-service (version 1.0.1.1)

### Introduction

Remote Logon Service is a broker client service for tracking the
availability of remote desktop services and making that information
available via DBus.

The Remote Logon Service obtains its information from a brokerage service
like X2Go Session Broker (or Canonical's discontinued UCCS service).

Arctica's Remote Logon Service is a fork and continuation of Ubuntu's
Remote Login Service, introduced with Ubuntu 12.10 [2].

### Release Announcement

On Saturday, Apr 29th 2017, version 1.0.1.1 of remote-logon-service [has
been
released](https://github.com/ArcticaProject/remote-logon-service/releases/tag/1.0.1.1)
[1].

This is the first official release of Arctica's Remote Logon Service
after having been forked from Ubuntu's remote-login-service (shipped with
Unity Greeter's remote login feature) [3].

Recent changes:

  * completely change name space from remote-login-service to
    remote-logon-service (s/login/logon/), no overlapping path
    names anymore
  * fix some FTBFS problems during unit tests (resolved by not
    instantiating the NMClient object anymore when testing)
